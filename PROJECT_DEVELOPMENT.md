## Functional Specifications
- - - 
### User Requirements
The user should easily be able to navigate the program. This statements only applies if the user is allowed access. The user should be allowed to manage and change the themes of GUI according to her prefrences. The user should also be allowed to choose

### Inputs and Outputs
The user be be able to input what data/information they are trying to find. In respone the GUI should output the info back.

### Core Features
The main purpose of this GUI is to proivde users with finding info easily. Buttons and commands must be easy to navigate and should not redirect to a different route. It is critical that this GUI meets user request otherwise the GUI is faulty and should not continue

### User Interaction
The Data is be viewed on a GUI. They can either press buttons or search from the bar

### Error Handling
The GUI should not crash and hand common errors gracefully. If there is an error it will restart the program and notify the devloper

## Use Cases

Actor: User(Preferably someone who wants to use the API)

Preconditions: Access to the internet and API (Spotify)

Main Flow:
1. Top tracks by artist - User enter an artist name; system retrieves and display top tracks by artist

2. Albums by artist - User enters an artist name; system retrieves and display albums by artist

3. Descripition of artist - User enters an artist name; system retrieves and display description of artist

4. Images of Artist - User enters an artist name; system retrieves and display images of artist

5. Exits â€“ Exits the program

6. Help - Shows options to fix program

Postconditions: Spotify Artist data is retrieved, stored, compared, or removed successfully.

## Testing and Debugging
---
### Intial commit/First commit (29/03/2025)
---
After problems with many API, i decided to try the spotify API. I went to https://developer.spotify.com/ and created an application so i could create an access token/ API key. I made a start on the UI by watching a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAmEZBEeNmg&pp=ygUWaG93IHRvIHVzZSBzcG90aWZ5IGFwaQ%3D%3D which help me create an understanding on how to get access from the Spotify API.

### Second commit (30/03/2025)
---
i continue working on my code to obtain an access token/ API key from Spotify API. i created a seperate main.py called main1.py to test the UI (later deleted). i faced many challenged including typos and f strings, leading to my UI completely crashing. I was very hesitant and worried if the UI wouldn't work, leading me to overthink and research for other APIs  By the end of the day i had finished the UI for the access token/ API key from the Spotify API

### Third commit (30/03/2025)
---
After i was able to obtain an access token/ API key from Spotify API, i started working on my functions. I want my function to provide the end-user with information about a specific artist so i create the first two buttons. top tracks,  displaying the top ten tracks of the artist and Albums, displaying all top twenty (or less) albums created by the artist. I had change the main1.py to test.py where i would test the UI (later deleted) This commit was the first time were the code was readble and understandble in the terminal.

### Fourth commit (31/03/2025)
---
I felt that i need to create more functions so the end-user had more flexibilty while running the UI. Two more functions were created, Description, displaying a brief description of the genre, popularity and followers of the artist and Images, dislpaying the images of the Artist in different sizes. The Spofity Api didn't provide a description for the artist so i took subheading to create a description for the Artist. I also Made a start on the UI of the Terminal. My UI used "While" and "IF" to display the info in the terminal and create a function which would ask the user if they wanted to learn more about the artist

### Fifth commit (01/04/2025)
---
I felt like i had the potential to make a GUi and not be basic, so i did research and found out tkinter was the easiest application to make and GUI. I had to change each functions "IF" statement to "DEF" function so it could be layout in the GUI. i also create custom Fonts and used colours to customised my API to match Spotify. During this stage, i encountered a lot of problems with the display in the GUI, including buttons not showing up an the code crashing during the run-time. I Create a Button for Exiting and the GUI was finished by the end of the Day

### Six commit (02/04/2025)
---
After finsihing my GUI, i decided to do testing and debugging to find any errors which came up. I did a lot of customised and orgranised my code so it was legible. I also start to work on the comments on my GUI but decided i would do it later. I would start to redo my theory from here

## Peer Evaluation
---
### Chris
Stephan's GUI had multiple features so that when you type in the artist name wrong it gives similier artist names. However the GUI screen could be further improved so that it won't be an eye sore to the users. The API that he used is unique as other people would not have thought of using it.

### Barry
Stephan's program works great, and looks visually appealing. It efficiently runs and functions as it's supposed to. Very useful in finding artists 10/10 would recommend
